# Weather App - Python (API Integration)

This Python application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data for a given city. Users can input city names and receive information such as temperature, 
humidity, and a description of the weather conditions. The app also features an interactive loop that allows users to check multiple cities or exit the program at any time.
